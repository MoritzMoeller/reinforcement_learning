# reinforcement_learning
Contains different reinforcement learning algorithms, including visualisation and analysis tools:

1. tabular_q_learning.py: Implementation of tabular q learning in OpenAI gym's frozen lake environment. While learning, produces animation of the value function and the preferred action according to the greedy policy.

2. deep_q_learning.py: Implementation of deep q learning in OpenAI gym's mountain cas environment. While learning, produces animation of the value function, contours of areas with constant greedy choice of action, and the current trajectory in state space.
